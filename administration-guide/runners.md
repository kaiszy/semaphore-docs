# Runners

Runners enable running tasks on a separate server from Ansible Semaphore.

Semaphore runners operate on the same principle as GitLab or GitHub Actions runners:

- You launch a runner on a separate server, specifying the Semaphore server's address and an authentication token.
- The runner connects to Semaphore and signals its readiness to accept tasks.
- When a new task appears, Semaphore provides all the necessary information to the runner, which, in turn, clones the repository and runs Ansible.
- The runner sends the task execution results back to Semaphore.

For end users, working with Semaphore with or without runners appears the same.

Using runners offers the following advantages:
- Executing tasks more securely. For instance, a runner can be located within a closed subnet or isolated docker container.
- Distributing the workload across multiple servers. You can start multiple runners, and tasks will be randomly distributed among them.

## Setup


The runner comes as part of Semaphore and is launched with the following command:

```bash
semaphore runner start --config ./config.json
```

The configuration file should contain a `runner` section with the following parameters:

```json
{
  "runner": {
    "registration_token": "***",
    "config_file": "path/to/the/file/where/runner/saves/service/information",
    "api_url": "http://<semaphore_host>:<semaphore_port>/api",
    "max_parallel_tasks": 10
  }
}
```

To enable Semaphore to work with runners, the following parameters should be present in its configuration file:

```json
{
  "use_remote_runner": true,
  "runner_registration_token": "***"
}
```
